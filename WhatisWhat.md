### Framework
FrameWork software  is collection of classes and interfaces To simplify application Development
we can classify three types of Frame Work Softwares
1. Persistence Framework--->Hibernate
2. WebFrameWork----------->Struts
3. EnterPrise FrameWork-------------->Spring
### Hibernate
useing Hibernate we can simplify Persistence layer/DAO layer
### Struts 
useing this frameWork S/w We can simplify WebApplications
### Spring
 useing this we can simplify Web And EnterPrise Development...
*  SpringCore
*  SpringJdbc
*  SpringOrm
*  SpringMvc Spring-ThirdpartyFrameWorks,SpringWebMvc
*  SpringAOP---------->Useing This we can SeparateMiddleWareServices from applications
*  SpringJEE------>SpringRMI,Hessan,Burlap,HttpInvoker,jms,ejb

### Distributed applications
The programs which are designed to talk to other programs which may be running on same or physically seperated but connected via network machines as well.
__javas APIs for distributed applications
* Cobra
* RMI
* EJB
* WebServices(SOAP and RESTful)

### 
### EJB

EJB is an acronym for enterprise java bean. It is a specification provided by Sun Microsystems to develop secured, robust and scalable distributed applications.

There are 3 types of enterprise bean in java.

__Session Bean__
Session bean contains business logic that can be invoked by local, remote or webservice client.

__Message Driven Bean__
Like Session Bean, it contains the business logic but it is invoked by passing message.

__Entity Bean__
It encapsulates the state that can be persisted in the database. It is deprecated. Now, it is replaced with JPA (Java Persistent API).

### Webservices
__Web Service__ is a technology that allows us to build interoperable distributed applications
