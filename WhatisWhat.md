### Framework
FrameWork software  is collection of classes and interfaces To simplify application Development
we can classify three types of Frame Work Softwares
1. Persistence Framework--->Hibernate
2. WebFrameWork----------->Struts
3. EnterPrise FrameWork-------------->Spring
### Hibernate
useing Hibernate we can simplify Persistence layer/DAO layer

__Def:__ Hibernate is a light weight opensource ORM software to devlop a database  independent OR mapping based persistance logic.

### Struts 
Struts is a Framework for building Servlet/JSP based web applications based on the MVC design paradigm
using this frameWork S/w We can simplify WebApplications
### Sprin-g
 useing this we can simplify Web And EnterPrise Development...
*  SpringCore
*  SpringJdbc
*  SpringOrm
*  SpringMvc Spring-ThirdpartyFrameWorks,SpringWebMvc
*  SpringAOP---------->Useing This we can SeparateMiddleWareServices from applications
*  SpringJEE------>SpringRMI,Hessan,Burlap,HttpInvoker,jms,ejb

### Distributed applications
The programs which are designed to talk to other programs which may be running on same or physically seperated but connected via network machines as well.
__javas APIs for distributed applications
* Cobra
* RMI
* EJB
* WebServices(SOAP and RESTful)


### EJB

EJB is an acronym for enterprise java bean. It is a specification provided by Sun Microsystems to develop secured, robust and scalable distributed applications.

There are 3 types of enterprise bean in java.

__Session Bean__
Session bean contains business logic that can be invoked by local, remote or webservice client.

__Message Driven Bean__
Like Session Bean, it contains the business logic but it is invoked by passing message.

__Entity Bean__
It encapsulates the state that can be persisted in the database. It is deprecated. Now, it is replaced with JPA (Java Persistent API).

### Webservices
__Web Service__ is a technology that allows us to build interoperable distributed applications

### JPA

Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts of data into a database which is provided by the Oracle Corporation.

JPA is an open source API, therefore various enterprise vendors such as Oracle, Redhat, Eclipse, etc. provide new products by adding the JPA persistence flavor in them. Some of these products include:

Hibernate, Eclipselink, Toplink, Spring Data JPA, etc.
